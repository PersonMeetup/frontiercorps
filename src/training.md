The Frontier is a harsh, unforgiving landscape where the act of reaching them was a challenge in itself. That's why emergency response training is so vital, as it can either help save your life or those around you. We collaborate with the Search and Rescue Association of Solace (SARAS) to provide high quality and educational training services throughout the Frontier, giving more citizens the tools needed to respond to a disaster.
