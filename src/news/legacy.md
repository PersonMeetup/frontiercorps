# EVAC ORDER: Biohazard on Olympus

At 8:54, an unauthorized automated fleet entered Psamathe airspace, with one ship (Tag: ICARUS) making a successful dock into Olympus at around 9:06. All other ships currently remain airbound. Current orders from the Mercenary Syndicate ask civilians to leave the area, recommending everyone in Olympus to stay inside and await further instructions.

The Frontier Corps and SARAS would like to elaborate on that warning, asking civilians to evacuate Olympus as soon as possible. It has recently been discovered that plant growths coming from all fleet ships emit toxic chemicals that, when inhaled, cause a fatal reaction within 72 hours. All civilians are advised to cover their mouths with the best equipment they have possible. If you do not have a mask you can use nearby, improvise.

The plants also have a high growth rate, which has allowed them to encircle Bonsi Plaza within a matter of hours. We suspect that other areas of the city will be affected by these growths as well. If your route has been blocked by the plants, look for any available detours. If none exist, you may try to cut down the plant at your own risk. We would advice using a axe as a minimum, however, and do not encourage attempting to use kitchen grade tools against the plant growths.

We recommend evacuees head towards the mechanical areas of Olympus for evacuation, as these spots are the furthest away from the contamination while still allowing for easy dropship access. All evacuees will be checked for symptoms of infection before they board so they can receive the proper services as soon as possible.

For those infected, an emergency responce team has been created and is currently working on a cure. More details will be given as soon as they are availible.
