# Annual Income Report for 2733

![](/img/Loadingscreen_Eavesdroppin_A_Line.png)

*As an effort to continuously focus on being as transparent as possible, the Frontier Corps puts out a set of annual reports dedicated to the current status and functions within the organization. This press release is dedicated to marking points of income for the organization within the past year.*

It's impossible to not acknowledge the impact that the Apex Games have had on our income these last few years, so it's always worth mentioning first and foremost. We want to say we're humbled for the effort that Ajay Che has put into supporting the Frontier Corps during her time in the games, as she often donates a significant portion of her winnings to support our cause. While the amount is still relatively low when covering our operation costs, it's enough that we were able to avoid disbanding due to lack of funds.

Public support follows the same rising trend of the last few years, which coincides an increase of awareness of the Frontier Corps. While part of the awareness no doubt comes from Ajay's appearances in the Apex Games, it also comes from the recent increase in disasters throughout the Outlands as of late. The recent devastation on World's Edge has served as a wake-up call to many regarding the need to support each other throughout the Frontier, a sentiment we also saw reflected in the rise of private donations.

We end off by saying we thank everyone for their generosity in supporting our cause. We hope to use your funds to unite the Frontier together once more.
