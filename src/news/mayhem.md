# EVAC ORDER: Attack on Kings Canyon

At 13:47, a terrorist attack occurred on the planet Solace during the Salvo welcoming ceremony at King's Canyon. Current extent of both damage and civilian casualties is unknown. Attackers have shown they're fully capable of compromising and abusing Syndicate security systems.

The Mercenary Syndicate has put an immediate evacuation order for any civilians in the area, recommending anyone outside the affected zone to stay inside and await further instructions. Frontier Corps members are currently moving to set up emergency response shelters for those who've been injured, with SARAS search and rescue operations currently underway.

The Frontier Corps would like to take this time to briefly address the impact of Salvo's inclusion in Syndicate space. While this will greatly improve the standard of living for an untold amount of souls, it's no secret that Salvo specializes in the production of military arms. There was, however, no restrictions put on the goods that they would legally be able to trade with Salvo's introduction into the union. We see this as a dangerous move that will put many high-tension communities at risk of self destruction, and will be pushing the Mercenary Syndicate for further action. We plan on publishing a full press release in the near future covering the full extent of Salvo's risk to public safety as they stand right now.
